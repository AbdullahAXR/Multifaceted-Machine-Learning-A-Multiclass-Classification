# Multifaceted Machine Learning: A Multiclass Classification

This project involves performing multiclass classification on a provided dataset. The aim is to understand and apply various machine learning techniques to analyze the dataset, perform feature selection and engineering, apply classifiers, and utilize active learning strategies to achieve high classification performance with minimal labeled data.

## Dataset Analysis and Classification

### Objective

- Perform dataset analysis including statistics and correlation analysis.
- Handle missing and imbalanced data.
- Conduct feature selection, transformation, and engineering.
- Apply and evaluate at least 4 classifiers, focusing on F1-macro as the main evaluation metric.

### Classifiers

- One linear classifier (either Logistic Regression or SVMs).
- One choice among KNN or Decision Trees.
- Neural Networks.
- Ensemble Learning (e.g., Random Forest, Adaboost).

### Tasks

- **Dataset Analysis:** Report on important dataset statistics, correlation analysis, and handling of missing or imbalanced data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Perform feature selection, transformation, and engineering to prepare the data for classification.
- **Classification:** Implement and tune at least 4 classifiers as described above.
- **Evaluation:** Choose appropriate evaluation measures with justifications, focusing on F1-macro as the main metric.
- **Error Analysis:** Perform error analysis and suggest possible improvements.
- **Final Results:** Report final results on the test set, highlighting the best-performing classifier and settings.

### Additional Ideas

Consider exploring more than 3 classifiers, investigating concepts such as margins, dimensionality reduction, feature scaling techniques, encoding categorical values, and interpreting learned models.

## Active Learning Strategies

### Objective

Implement at least two active learning strategies to label the training data effectively, starting with 100 randomly labeled samples. The goal is to achieve comparable results to Part-A with a minimal number of samples labeled.
